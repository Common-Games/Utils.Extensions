Our set of shared extension methods / static utility methods.

For now it's mostly meant for in-house, as a dependency, however, this will change later on.
There are many Unit Tests/Benchmarks I have to create and lots of docs to do for this one.

<br>Part of the **CGTK** Framework for Unity.

# Requirements

- **Unity 2020.3**
- The **Unity Test Framework** Package

# Installation

#### Install the latest *stable release* by following these steps:

1. Click on **Window/Package Manager**.
2. Click on the little + icon.
3. Click on button that says **Add Package from git URL**.
4. Put in `https://github.com/Walter-Hulsebos/Utilities.Extensions.git`

And you're done! ;-)

### Tests

The package can optionally be set as *testable*.
This means that the tests from the package will be visible in the [Unity Test Runner](https://docs.unity3d.com/2017.4/Documentation/Manual/testing-editortestsrunner.html).

Open your project's `Packages/manifest.json` with your favorite text editor. Add following line **after** the dependencies block:
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
  },
  "testables": [ "com.common-games.utilities.extensions" ]
}
```

# Documentation

Every bit of *public* API on the master branch of this package has been unit-tested and benchmarked.
But you should also run all unit tests yourself as they are included. 
We can never know if you have all the dependencies, your target platform, or your Unity version. 

The documentation is separated into these parts; 
- [Examples](#examples)
- [Overview API](#overview-api).
